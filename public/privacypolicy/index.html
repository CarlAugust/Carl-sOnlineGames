        <h2>Account details</h2>
        <p>• This application requires the usage of a username and password such that we can create a unique account with your username and give you the ability to protect that account via your password.</p>
        <p>• The password is stored in a database using a hashed form such that your password is protected from third parties, even in cases of data leakage.</p>
        <p>• This application allows you to optionally use your email as a unique identifier for your user. However, if you decide not to connect your account to an email, we cannot guarantee the ability to recover or delete your account if you forgot your password. This is because your email is the only third-party method to authorize your account. This also means that if your email is not valid or not yours to begin with, we would not be able to guarantee the ability to recover or delete your account.</p>
        <p>• All accounts and their details as mentioned above are stored in a database with a unique id identification defined by the database.</p>

        <p>• We store your account details except for your password in the cookies to keep you logged in and such that we can get a unique identifier when you play games. This is a must as we require you to have an account and to be logged in to use this account.</p>
        <p>• It is also used to check if you have a premium account without us having to check the database every single time.</p>
        <h3>Personalized cookies</h3>
        <p>• These are not necessary, and the user can accept if they want these cookies or not and we store the state of the agreement in our database and necessary cookies.</p>
